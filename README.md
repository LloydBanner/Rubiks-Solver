# Rubiks-Solver
A Rubik's Cube implementation with software solutions for my final year university project.

Project Specification:

Write a solver for a Rubik's cube.

There are a number of well-known algorithms for solving Rubik's cubes.

Begin by developing a method to store the state of the cube, and how it may be manipulated. Then you may start by implementing the simplest solver method, as described by Rubik's themselves [1]. Consider other methods (often known as speed-cubing) and compare and contrast different algorithms [2].

The worst case (or God's Number) is 20 moves to solve a Rubik's cube for any configuration. Try to create a solver that can produce the best solution within a reasonable time frame [3]. You may need to consider parallelism in order to arrive at an optimal solution.

You can further extend this project by considering 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 cubes. You could also look at ways in which to display the optimal solution to a user.
